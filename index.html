  <blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;In most people&#8217;s vocabularies, design is a veneer. It&#8217;s interior decorating. It&#8217;s the fabric of the curtains, of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product.&#8221;</p>

        t's useful to start with an overview of the language's history. JavaScript
         was created in 1995 by Brendan Eichwhile he was an engineer at Netscape.
         JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally
          goingto be called LiveScript,
          but it was renamed in an ill-fated
          marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity
           of Sun Microsystem's Java language â€” despite the two having very
            little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.
          Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no
             concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language
             in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide
             mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. </p>
             <p class="mustard">Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any
     language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those
      values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:</p>
